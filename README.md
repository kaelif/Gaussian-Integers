### Definition
A Gaussian Integer is defined as a complex numbers with both real and imaginary components being integers.
The set of all complex numbers is a field extension of the set of all real numbers and is written in the form z = x + yi, where x and y are in the set of reals and i represents the imaginary unit sqrt(-1). 

Gaussian Integers are therefore expressed in the form z = x + yi, where x and y are in the set of integers and i represents the imaginary unit sqrt(-1).
