\begin{frame}{Complex Numbers}
\begin{itemize}
 \item<1-> Before any definition of Gaussian Integers can be provided in a comprehensive way, it is necessary to first provide a definition for Complex Numbers, as the set of Gaussian Integers form a subring of the field of Complex Numbers
 \item<2-> The set of the complex numbers are defined as $\mathbb{C} = \{x + yi| x, y \in \mathbb{R}, i = \sqrt{-1}\}$
 \item<3-> Here, x is considered the real component of $z$, or $Re(z)$ and y is considered the imaginary component of $z$, or $Im(z)$
 \item<4-> Complex numbers are generally represented using an xy-coordinate system with x representing the real component and with y representing the imaginary component

\end{itemize}  
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Complex Norms}
\begin{itemize}
     \item<1-> The norm of a complex number $z = x + yi$ is defined by $|z| = |x + yi| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ and is equivalent to the complex number's distance from the origin    
     \item<2-> This allows for alternative representation of complex numbers using both it's norm and it's angle from the real axis, known as it's argument and represented as $Arg(z)$
     \item<3-> It should be noted that this definition used the notation $Arg(z)$ specifically with the "a" being capitalized. This indicates that the angle is within $[0, 2\pi)$

        Any Gaussian Integer $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$ is considered to be a unit if it has a multiplicative inverse. This is to say that, i.e.:\\

\begin{frame}{Divisibility in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ (Cont.)}
    \setbeamercolor{block title}{fg = white, bg = black}
    \begin{block}{Proposition 1}
        A Gaussian integer $\alpha \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a unit $\leftrightarrow N(\alpha) = 1 \land \alpha \in \{-1, 1, -i, i\} = \{i^k | k = 0, 1, 2, 3\}$
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{block}{Proof.}
        $(\rightarrow)$ Suppose $u\in\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a unit. Then, there exists $x\in\mathbb{Z}[i]$ such that $ux=1.$ Taking the norm of this equation we find that $N(ux)=N(u)N(x)=1.$ Hence $N(u)=1.$\\
        
        $(\leftarrow)$ Conversely, suppose $u\in\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is such that $N(u)=1.$ Then, if $u=a+bi$ for $a,b\in\mathbb{Z},$ it would follow that $N(u)=N(a+bi)=a^2+b^2=1.$ 
    \end{block}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Divisibility in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ (Cont.)}
    \setbeamercolor{block title}{fg = white, bg = black}
    \begin{proof}
    We see that the following set of ordered pairs $(a,b)$ is an exhaustive set of solutions to $a^2+b^2=1:$
$$\{(1,0),(0,1),(-1,0),(0,-1)\}$$
These ordered pairs correspond to the Gaussian integers $1,i,-1,-i$ respectively. Indeed, $\{\pm1,\pm i\}$ are all the units of $\mathbb{Z}[i].$ 
    \end{proof}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Divisibility in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ (Cont.)}
    \setbeamercolor{block title}{fg = white, bg = darkturquoise}
    \begin{block}{Definition 2 (Associates)}
        Two Gaussian Integers $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{Z}$ are said to be associates if $\exists \delta \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$ s.t. $\delta$ is a unit and $\alpha = \beta \delta$\\
        By Proposition 1, this is equivalent to $\alpha = i^k\beta$
    \end{block}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Divisibility in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ (Cont.)}
    \begin{block}{Definition 3 (The Ideal)}
        Let $\beta \in \mathbb{Z}[i].$ We define the Ideal of $\beta$ to be the set of all $\mathbb{Z}[i]$-multiples of $\beta:$\\
$$<\beta>:=\{\beta x\mid x\in\mathbb{Z}[i]\}$$
From this definition it follows that $\beta \mid \alpha$ if and only if $\alpha \in <\beta>.$ One also sees that if $u\in\mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a unit then $<u>=\mathbb{Z}[i].$
    \end{block}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Divisibility in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ (Cont.)}
    \begin{block}{Definition 4 (Greatest Common Divisor)}
        Given two Gaussian integers $\alpha, \beta$ not both equal to zero, we define the set of common divisors of $\alpha, \beta$ as:
$$\{X\in\mathbb{Z}[i]: X\mid \alpha \text{ and } X\mid\beta\}$$
There will be an $X$ with maximal norm in this set, and it is this $X$ that we call the greatest common divisor of $\alpha$ and $\beta.$ We denote this as $\text{gcd}(\alpha, \beta)=X.$ The gcd is unique up to associates, as $\delta=\text{gcd(}\alpha,\beta)\mid \alpha,\beta$ implies that for any unit $u,$ $u\delta\mid\alpha$ and $u\delta\mid \beta$. When gcd($\alpha,\beta)=1$ we say $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are coprime. \\\\

Our first theorem will establish a general "long division" of Gaussian integers which is indeed very similar to long division in $\mathbb{Z}.$
    \end{block}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Theorem 1 (The Divisibility Theorem)}
    \setbeamercolor{block title}{fg = white, bg = black}
    \begin{block}{The Divisor Theorem}
        Given Gaussian integers $\alpha,
\beta\neq 0,$ there exists $Q,R\in\mathbb{Z}[i]$ such that 
$$\alpha=Q\beta + R \text{  and  } N(R)\leq \frac{N(\beta)}{2}$$\\
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Proof}
        \begin{proofs}
            We begin by performing the following division in $\mathbb{C}:$
$$\frac{\alpha}{\beta} =x+iy$$
Where $x,y\in\mathbb{R}.$ In constructing the desired quotient $\alpha=Q\beta +R$ we choose integers $m,n$ such that:
$$\mid x-m\mid \leq \frac{1}{2}$$
        \end{proofs}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{The Divisibility Theorem (Cont.)}
\setbeamercolor{block title}{fg = white, bg = black}
    \begin{block}{Proof}
    also
$$\mid y-n\mid \leq \frac{1}{2}.$$
        We can certainly find such an $m$ and $n$ since every real number is at most distance $\frac{1}{2}$ from the nearest integer. This choice of $m,n$ yields:
$$N(x-m+i(y-n))=(x-m)^2+(y-n)^2\leq (\frac{1}{2})^2+(\frac{1}{2})^2=\frac{1}{2}.$$
    \end{block}
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{The Divisibility Theorem (Cont.)}
    \setbeamercolor{block title}{fg = white, bg = black}
    \begin{block}{Proof}
        Setting $Q=m+in$ and $R=\beta(x-m+i(y-n))$ gives the desired quotient since:
            \begin{align*}
                \beta Q+R =& \beta(m+in)\\ +\beta(x-m+i(y-n))\\
                =& \beta(m-m+in-in+x+iy)\\ =& \beta(x+iy)\\
                =& a.
            \end{align*}
    Where the last equality follows from $\frac{\alpha}{\beta}=x+iy$. \\
    \end{block}
w\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{The Divisibility Theorem (Cont.)}
    \setbeamercolor{block title}{fg = white, bg = black}
    \begin{proof}
It remains to show that the remainder $R$ has the desired norm $\leq \frac{N(\beta)}{2}.$\\
This follows from the calculation:
$$N(R)=N(\beta)N(x-m+i(y-n))=N(\beta)((x-m)^2+(y-n)^2)\leq \frac{N(\beta)}{2}$$
Proving Theorem 1.
    \end{proof}
    
Notice that unlike the analog of this theorem in $\mathbb{Z},$ the choice of $Q,R$ is not guaranteed to be unique. One can impose additional restrictions on the remainder to secure uniqueness. \\\\
With these definitions and results, we may define the notion of primality in $\mathbb{Z}[i].$ \\

\begin{frame}{Gaussian Primes}
    In order to avoid ambiguity in the terms "integer" and "prime", we provide clarification in Definition 5:\\
    \setbeamercolor{block title}{fg = white, bg = darkturquoise}
    \begin{block}{Definition 5 (Rational Integer and Rational Prime)}
         A rational integer is simply an element of $\mathbb{Z}.$ A prime in $\mathbb{Z}$ is called a rational prime. \\\\
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Definition 6 (Trivial Factorization)}
        Let $\gamma \in\mathbb{Z}[i].$ Suppose $\gamma$ factors in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ as $\gamma=\alpha \beta.$ This factorization is called trivial when one of $\alpha$ or $\beta$ is a unit. In this case, one notes that the other factor is associated to $\gamma.$\\\\
    \end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Gaussian Primes (Cont.)}
    \setbeamercolor{block title}{fg = white, bg = darkturquoise}
    \begin{block}{Definition 7 (Gaussian Prime)}
        A Gaussian prime $\pi$ is a Gaussian integer which cannot be written as the product of two non units. That is, if we have a factorization $$\pi = \alpha \beta \in\mathbb{Z}[i],$$
then $\alpha$ is a unit and $\beta$ is associate to $\pi.$ Equivalently, $\pi$ cannot be written as the product of two Gaussian integers, each smaller in norm than $\pi,$ and $\pi$ has no non trivial factorization.\\\\
    \end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Gaussian Primes (Cont.)}
    \begin{block}{Definition 7 (Gaussian Prime)}
        There are a few immediately interesting observations about primes in $\mathbb{Z}[i].$ For instance, the integers $2$ and $5$ are rational primes, yet in $\mathbb{Z}[i],$ these integers have the non trivial factorizations:
$$(1+i)(1-i)=2$$
$$(2+i)(2-i)=5,$$
and so neither $2$ nor $5$ are Gaussian primes. 
    \end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Gaussian Primes (Cont.)}
    \setbeamercolor{block title}{fg = white, bg = darkturquoise}
    \begin{block}{Definition 7 (Gaussian Prime)}
    Notice that each of the factors is smaller in norm than the product, and neither factor is a unit. We will come to see that $p$ a rational prime is also a Gaussian prime if and only if $p\equiv 3$ (mod $4).$ Furthermore, one notes that $(1+i)$ and $(2+i)$ are Gaussian primes with a direct application of Proposition 2, shown below. 
The following propositions will be useful in our study of the Gaussian primes:\\\\

\begin{frame}{Gaussian Primes (Cont.)}
    \setbeamercolor{block title}{fg = white, bg = black}
    \begin{block}{Proposition 2}
        Let $\alpha,\beta \in\mathbb{Z}[i].$ If $\beta \mid \alpha$ then $N(\beta)\mid N(\alpha).$\\
    \end{block}
    \begin{proof}
        If $\beta \mid \alpha$ then for some $X\in\mathbb{Z}[i]$ we have $X\beta=\alpha.$ Evaluating the norm on this equation gives:
$$N(\alpha)=N(X)N(\beta)$$
Which implies that $N(\beta)\mid N(\alpha)$ as required. \\\\
    \end{proof}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Gaussian Primes (Cont.)}
    \setbeamercolor{block title}{fg = white, bg = black}
    \begin{block}{Proposition 3}
        If $z\in\mathbb{Z}[i]$ and $N(z)=p,$ a rational prime, then $z$ is a Gaussian prime.\\
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Proof.}
        \begin{proofs}
        We take a factorization of $z$ as a product of two Gaussian integers:
$$z=\alpha \beta,$$
for some $\alpha,\beta \in\mathbb{Z}[i].$ By the previous Proposition we have: $N(\alpha)\mid N(z)=p,$ and since $p$ is a rational prime, it follows that either $N(\alpha)=1$ or $N(\alpha)=p.$ If $N(\alpha)=1$ then by Proposition 1, $\alpha$ is a unit and so $z$ is a Gaussian prime. On the other hand, if $N(\alpha)=p$ then $N(\beta)=1$ and thus $\beta$ is a unit. 
    \end{proofs}
    \end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Gaussian Primes (Cont.)}
    \setbeamercolor{block title}{fg = white, bg = black}
    \begin{proof}
        Since any factorization of $z$ includes a unit, we deduce that $z$ is indeed a Gaussian prime, as required. \\\\
Our next theorem gives a helpful representation of the gcd of two Gaussian integers. This is the analog of "BÃ©zout's Theorem" in number theory. \\\\

    Our next theorem gives a helpful representation of the gcd of two Gaussian integers. This is the analog of "BÃ©zout's Theorem" in number theory. 
    \begin{block}{Definition (BÃ©zouts Theorem in $\mathbf{Z}[i]$}
    Let $\delta\in\mathbb{Z}[i]$ be a greatest common divisor of $\alpha,\beta\in\mathbb{Z}[i].$ Then, there exists $x,y\in\mathbb{Z}[i]$ such that $$\alpha x+\beta y=\delta.$$\\

    \end{block}
    
    \setbeamercolor{block text}{fg = white, bg = black}
    \begin{proof}
    We consider the set $S:$
$$S:=\{\alpha x+\beta y \mid x,y\in\mathbb{Z}[i] \text{ and } N(\alpha x+\beta y)>0\}$$
There is an element in this set with the smallest norm (there may be multiple elements with the smallest norm -- in this case, we select one of them), call it $d.$ Since $d\in S,$ we can write:
$d=\alpha x_0 +\beta y_0,$ for some $x_0,y_0\in\mathbb{Z}[i].$\\
    \end{proof}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{BÃ©zouts Theorem in $\mathbf{Z}[i]$}
    \setbeamercolor{block text}{fg = white, bg = black}
    \begin{block}{Proof}
    Claim 1: $d\mid \alpha$ and $d\mid \beta.$\\
Proof of Claim: Using Theorem 1 we preform this division in $\mathbb{Z}[i]:$\\
$$\alpha=dQ+R \text{ where Q,R} \in\mathbb{Z}[i] \text{ and } 0\leq N(R)\leq\frac{N(d)}{2}$$
This yields that:
$$R=\alpha -dQ=\alpha(1-Qx_0)+\beta(-y_0 Q)$$
and thus if $N(R)>0,$ then $R$ would be an element of $S.$ However, $R$ cannot be an element of $S$ since $N(R)<N(d)$ and $d$ has minimal norm. Hence, $N(R)=0$ and thus $R=0.$ We have found that $\alpha =dQ$ and so $d\mid \alpha.$ An identical argument yields that $d\mid\beta.$ This concludes the proof of Claim 1.\\

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{BÃ©zouts Theorem in $\mathbf{Z}[i]$}

    \setbeamercolor{block title}{fg = white, bg = black}
    \begin{block}{Proof}
    Hence $d$ is a common divisor of $\alpha, \beta.$ Additionally, since:
$$d=\alpha x_0+\beta y_0$$
we see that any common divisor of $\alpha,\beta$ is also a divisor of $d.$ This proves that gcd$(\alpha,\beta)=d=\delta,$ and setting $X=x_0, Y=y_0$ we get:
$$\text{gcd}(\alpha, \beta)=\delta = \alpha X+\beta Y$$
as required to show BÃ©zouts Theorem holds in $\mathbf{Z}[i]$. $\square$\\\\

\begin{frame}{Generalized Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic}
    We  now  ask  whether  the  Fundamental  Theorem  of Arithmetic  can  be  generalized  to  the Gaussian integers. Indeed,  one  can  assert  a  suitable generalization  of  the  Fundamental Theorem  of Arithmetic  in $\mathbf{Z}[i]$. To prove this important fact, we will need the following Proposition:
    
    \setbeamercolor{blck title}{fg = white, bg = black}
    \begin{block}{Proposition}
    Let $\pi$ be a Gaussian prime and $z_i\in\mathbb{Z}[i].$ If $\pi\mid z_1 \ldots z_n$ for $n\geq 1,$ then $\pi\mid z_j$ for some $j\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$.

\setbeamercolor{block title}{fg = white, bg = black}
\begin{frame}{Proposition}
\setbeamercolor{block title}{fg = white, bg = black}
    \begin{block}{Proposition}
    Let $\pi$ be a Gaussian prime and $z_i\in\mathbb{Z}[i].$ If $\pi\mid z_1 \ldots z_n$ for $n\geq 1,$ then $\pi\mid z_j$ for some $j\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$.
    \end{block}
    \setbeamercolor{block title}{fg = white, bg = black}
    \begin{block}{Proof}
    We proceed with induction. When $n=1,2$ the result follows by Corollary 2. Assume that Proposition 4 is true for all $k$ with $2<k<n.$ Next we show the result is true for $n.$ Suppose that $\pi\mid z_1\ldots z_n.$ By Corollary 2, either $\pi\mid z_1$ or $\pi\mid z_2\ldots z_n.$ If $\pi\mid z_1$ then we are done. If $\pi\mid z_2\ldots z_n,$ then we have a prime dividing a product of $n-1$ terms. Since the number of terms in the product is less than $n,$ we can apply the inductive hypothesis to find that $\pi \mid z_j$ for some $j\in\{2,\ldots, n\}.$ So if $\pi\mid z_1 \ldots z_n$ for $n\geq 1,$ then $\pi\mid z_j$ for some $j\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$.

\begin{frame}{Unique Gaussian Prime Factorization}
    An interesting application of the theorems and definitions we have discussed in this presentation is Unique Gaussian Prime Factorization. 
    
    \setbeamercolor{block title}{fg = white, bg = blue}
    \begin{block}{Theorem - Unique Gaussian Prime Factorization}
 A Gaussian integer $\alpha$ can be written uniquely as a product of Gaussian primes up to a reordering of the factors and multiplication by a unit. That is:
$$\alpha = u\prod_{i=1}^{n}\pi_i^{\gamma_i}$$
is a unique expression where $u$ is a unit, $\pi_i$ for $i\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$ are distinct (non associate) Gaussian primes, and $n,\gamma_i$ are non-negative integers.

\begin{frame}{Unique Gaussian Prime Factorization}
There are two steps to prove the Unique Gaussian Prime Factorization theorem.
    \setbeamercolor{block title}{fg = white, bg = black}
    \begin{block}{Proposition 1}
 We first prove that such a prime factorization exists, then we show that it is essentially unique.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Unique Gaussian Prime Factorization Proof}
    \setbeamercolor{block title}{fg = white, bg = black}
    \begin{block}{Proof (Existence)}
We use induction on the norm of $\alpha.$ For the base case, note that if $N(\alpha)=1$ then $\alpha\in\{\pm 1,\pm i\}$ is written as the empty product of primes times the unit $\alpha.$ Suppose that all Gaussian integers $z$ with $1<N(z)<m$ have prime factorizations. We show that also $\alpha$ with $N(\alpha)=m$ has a prime factorization. If $\alpha$ is a Gaussian prime then we have its prime factorization as simply $\alpha.$ Hence, we may assume $\alpha$ is not a Gaussian prime. But this implies there is a nontrivial factorization:
$$\alpha = XY \text{ for some } X,Y\in\mathbb{Z}[i]$$

\setbeamercolor{block title}{fg = white, bg = black}
\begin{block}{Proof (Existence)}
Applying the norm, we find that $N(X),N(Y)<N(\alpha)=m,$ and thus we can apply the inductive hypothesis to both $X$ and $Y$ to find that:
$$X=u\prod_{i=1}^{r}\pi_i \text{   and      }Y=u'\prod_{j=1}^{s}\rho_j$$
for Gaussian primes $\pi_i, \rho_j$ and units $u,u'.$ Hence we get that:
$$\alpha=uu'\prod_{i=1}^{r}\pi_i\prod_{j=1}^{s}\rho_j$$
Showing that $\alpha$ can be written as a product of primes. By induction, the Existence claim follows. \\

\begin{frame}{Unique Gaussian Prime Factorization Proof}
\setbeamercolor{block title}{fg = white, bg = black}
    \begin{block}{Proof (Uniqueness)}
    Assume that $\alpha$ is a Gaussian integer which can be expressed as a product of two different collections of primes. That is:
$$\alpha =\pi_1\ldots\pi_k=\rho_1\ldots\rho_\ell$$
where $\{\overline{\pi_i}\mid 1\leq i\leq k\}\neq\{\overline{\rho_j} \mid 1\leq j\leq \ell\}$ and all of $\pi_i,\rho_j$ are Gaussian primes. Further assume that among the Gaussian integers which have two different prime factorizations, $\alpha$ has the smallest norm (we choose $\alpha$ to have minimal norm even if the choice is not unique). 
\end{block}

\begin{frame}{Unique Gaussian Prime Factorization Proof}
\setbeamercolor{block title}{fg = white, bg = black}
\begin{block}{Proof (Uniqueness)}
Thus we can form a new Gaussian integer called $\beta$ according to:
$$\beta := \frac{\alpha}{\pi_1} =\pi_2\ldots\pi_k=\frac{\rho_1\ldots\rho_\ell}{\pi_1}$$
From this we find that $\pi_1 \mid \rho_1\ldots\rho_\ell,$ and so applying Proposition 4 gives: $\pi_1\mid \rho_j$ for some $j\in\{1,\ldots,\ell\}.$ Using a suitable renumbering, we can assert that $\pi_1\mid\rho_1.$ Then we know that $\{\overline{\pi_2},\ldots \overline{\pi_k}\}\neq\{\overline{\rho_2},\dots,\overline{\rho_{\ell}}\}, $ and so $\beta$ has two different prime factorizations:
$$\beta = \pi_2\ldots \pi_k = \rho_2 \ldots \rho_{\ell}$$\\
 Noting that $N(\beta)=\frac{N(\alpha)}{N(\pi_1)}<N(\alpha)$  we encounter a contradiction regarding the minimality of $\alpha,$ since we found a Gaussian integer $\beta$ smaller than $\alpha$ which has two different prime factorizations.

\begin{frame}{Fermatâs Sum of Two Squares}
    Another interesting application of the theorems and definitions we have discussed in this presentation is Fermatâs Sum of Two Squares. With these facts, we can state and prove Fermatâs Theorem on the sum of two squares, a theorem that, without the use of the Unique factorization of the Gaussian integers, is harder to prove.

    Let $p$ be an odd prime. Then, there exists integers $x,y$ such that $x^2+y^2=p$ if and only if $p\equiv 1 \pmod 4.$\\

\begin{frame}{Fermatâs Sum of Two Squares}
\setbeamercolor{block title}{fg = white, bg = black}
    \begin{block}{Proof ($\rightarrow$)} One finds by squaring the numbers $\{0,1,2,3\}$ and reducing modulo $4$ that $0$ and $1$ are the only possible residues produced by squaring an integer modulo 4. Assume $x^2+y^2=p$ for some integers $x,y.$  Reducing this equation modulo 4 gives: $$x^2+y^2\equiv p \equiv \pm 1 \pmod 4$$ But since $x^2+y^2$ can only ever be congruent to one of $0,1,2$ modulo 4, we deduce that $p\not\equiv 3 \pmod 4$ and hence $p\equiv 1 \pmod 4.$\\

\begin{frame}{Fermatâs Sum of Two Squares}
\setbeamercolor{block title}{fg = white, bg = black}
\begin{block}{Proof ($\leftarrow$)}
    Assume $p\equiv 1 \pmod 4.$ From Proposition 6 we know that there exists an integer $m$ such that $p\mid m^2+1.$ We note that though $p\nmid m+i$ and $p\nmid m-i,$ $p$ does in fact divide the product $(m+i)(m-i)=m^2+1.$ By Proposition 7, we know that $p$ cannot be a Gaussian prime. Thus, by Theorem 3, $p$ has a Gaussian prime factorization:  $$p=\prod_{i=1}^{n} \pi_i,$$ where each of the $\pi_i$ are Gaussian primes. Also: $$N(p)=p^2=\prod_{i=1}^{n} N(\pi_i)$$

\begin{frame}{Fermatâs Sum of Two Squares}
\setbeamercolor{block title}{fg = white, bg = black}
\begin{block}{Proof ($\leftarrow$)}
$$N(p)=p^2=\prod_{i=1}^{n} N(\pi_i)$$
This in turn implies that each $\pi_i$ has $N(\pi_i)=p$ and thus $n=2.$ Let $\pi_1=x+iy\in\mathbb{Z}[i].$ Then we have that: $$p=N(\pi_1)=(x+iy)(x-iy)=x^2+y^2$$
and thus we have written the prime $p\equiv 1 \pmod 4$ as a sum of two squares, proving the theorem.
